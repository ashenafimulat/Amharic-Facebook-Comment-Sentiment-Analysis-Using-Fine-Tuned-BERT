# Amharic Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for a **sentiment analysis project** focused on Amharic Facebook comments. The project leverages a **fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model** to classify the sentiment of comments as **strongly positive, positive, strongly negative, negative, or neutral**. 

Amharic, being a **low-resource language**, presents unique challenges in **natural language processing (NLP)**. This project aims to address those challenges by adapting state-of-the-art **transformer models**.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Fine-Tuned BERT Model**: A pre-trained **BERT model** is fine-tuned on a custom dataset of Amharic Facebook comments for sentiment classification.
- **Amharic Language Support**: The project focuses on sentiment analysis for **Amharic text**, addressing the scarcity of **NLP resources** for this language.
- **Dataset**: Includes a curated dataset of Amharic Facebook comments labeled with sentiment (**strongly positive, positive, strongly negative, negative, or neutral**).
- **Preprocessing**: Tools for **cleaning and preprocessing Amharic text** to improve model performance.
- **Evaluation**: Comprehensive **evaluation metrics** (**accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score**) to assess model performance.
